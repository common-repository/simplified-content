A plugin which generates alternative 'simplified' content for a given set of browsers.  Useful legacy browser support and intranet systems.

== Description ==
Simplified Content, provides visitors with alternative 'simplified' content whenever they visit your website using any targeted browser.  Useful for website managers who wish to provide basic fallback for legacy browsers, e.g. simplified content for IE 8, or to block certain browsers for intranet systems. 

The plugin allows you to select one or more browsers from a settings page to target for alternative content.  The plugin requires a target Site Map page to use as a new root page for all website navigation.  The plugin provides the visitor with a simplified navigational system, moving from the site map to any page referenced in the site map, and a simple 'back to site map' link at the top of each page.

WARNING: This is an aggressive plugin which provides very simple functionality for configured browsers.  Once set, any configured browsers will cease to function for administrative and normal wordpress operations.
Please ensure that you have other browsers available to use for administration and testing purposes.

####Features:

1. Choose multiple browsers from a settings page.
2. Automatic generation of simplified content.  Requires no editing of content. Note:  javascript, and media rich content is ignored by this plugin.
3. Choose any page to target as the sitemap page.
4. Easy to customize 'welcome/apology message', header, footer and styles of basic content.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why would you need this plugin? =
At Oxford Information Labs Limited we needed a plugin to easily handle IE8 browsers out-of-the-box.  We didn't want to generate alternative content for such old browsers, but we wanted to offers visitors 'something' to work with, even if that content was degraded.  As we developed the plugin, we realised that it would also be useful for our Wordpress based intranet systems.  For example, one system we have is for IE11, only.  Any body visiting the intranet site from other browsers is presented with a friendly reminder message.
